    "We have already explored our first classification model (logistic regression), but the world of machine learning offers many more powerful algorithms to choose from. One of the most intuitive and interpretable of these is the **Decision Tree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Decision Trees Work:**\n",
    "Decision trees mirror human decision-making by creating a hierarchical structure of questions. Starting at the **root node**, the algorithm systematically creates **internal nodes** (decision points) and **leaf nodes** (final predictions) by asking binary questions about the features in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example:**\n",
    "When predicting an animal's family, a decision tree might ask:\n",
    "- Root question: \"Does the animal have fur?\"\n",
    "  - If YES → \"Does it have four legs?\"\n",
    "    - If YES → \"Does it bark?\" → Dog/Cat classification\n",
    "    - If NO → \"Does it swing from trees?\" → Primate classification\n",
    "  - If NO → \"Does it have feathers?\" → Bird/Reptile classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **node** represents a decision point based on feature values, and each **branch** represents the outcome of that decision. This creates an easily interpretable set of rules that even non-technical stakeholders can understand and validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Advantages:**\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Every prediction can be traced through a clear path of decisions\n",
    "- **No data preprocessing**: Works with mixed data types without scaling or normalization\n",
    "- **Automatic feature selection**: Identifies the most important features for classification\n",
    "- **Handles non-linear relationships**: Can capture complex patterns that linear models miss"
