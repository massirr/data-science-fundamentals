Classification vs Regression:

Classification (What we're doing now): Used when predicting categories/labels (like Mine vs Rock)
Regression (What you did in chapters 2-3): Used when predicting continuous values (like prices or temperatures)

Variable Types:

Categorical Variables (like 'Material' in this dataset):
Represent categories/labels
Examples: Mine/Rock, Yes/No, Red/Blue/Green
Continuous Variables (like the sonar readings):
Represent numerical measurements
Examples: temperature, price, age

When to Use Each:

Use Classification when your target variable is categorical
Logistic Regression (Chapter 4)
Decision Trees (Chapter 5)
k-NN (Current Chapter)
Use Regression when your target variable is continuous
Linear Regression (Chapter 2)
Polynomial Regression (Chapter 3)
